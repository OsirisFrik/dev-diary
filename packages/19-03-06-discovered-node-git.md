Well, one time learning about `Geeks Diary` and try to install  dev proyect and debugin a error in my console, I faind the package `NodeGit` to work `Git` whith `NodeJs`.

And it's so cool!! -> [NodeGit](https://www.nodegit.org/)

It's so much easy to use, look that

## Clone repo


```javascript
var Git = require("nodegit");

Git.Clone("https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit", "nodegit").then(function(repository) {
  // Work with the repository object here.
});
```


So now i have a new tool to create a new tools to my work.
